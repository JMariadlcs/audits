| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Critical](#Critical) | Easily exploitable by anyone, causing loss/manipulation of assets or data.                                                         |
| [High](#High)         | Arduously exploitable by a subset of addresses, causing loss/manipulation of assets or data.                                       |
| [Medium](#Medium)     | Inherent risk of future exploits that may or may not impact the smart contract execution due to current or future implementations. |
| [Low](#Low)           | Minor deviation from best practices.                                                                                               |

## Disclaimer

A comprehensive evaluation of smart contract security can never guarantee the absolute absence of vulnerabilities. Such an evaluation is subject to limitations in terms of time, resources, and expertise, and aims to identify as many potential vulnerabilities as possible. Therefore, even after the evaluation, it cannot be ensured that 100% security has been achieved, or that any potential issues with the smart contracts have been identified. It is strongly recommended to conduct subsequent security reviews, bug bounty programs, and on-chain monitoring to ensure continued security.
