# JMariadlcs - devScrooge Smart Contract Audits

This repository serves as a compilation of all the security audit contributions made by JMariadlcs - devScrooge. The audits are divided into 3 main categories: solo audits, team-up audits, and reported issues from auditing competitions. Some of the private audits are conducter under the name of [Guardian Audits](https://twitter.com/guardianaudits) and [UNSNARL](https://twitter.com/unsnarl_secure) to which I currently participate.
