# Audit Scope & Methodology

## Scope

| ID  | File                        | Checksum |
| --- | --------------------------- | -------- |
| A   | diva-contracts/contracts/\* | -        |
| B   | oracles/contracts/\*        | -        |

## Methodology

The auditing process pays special attention to the following considerations:

- Testing the smart contracts against both common and uncommon attack vectors.
- Assessing the codebase to ensure compliance with current best practices and industry standards.
- Ensuring contract logic meets the specifications and intentions of the client.
- Cross-referencing contract structure and implementation against similar smart contracts produced by industry leaders.
- Thorough line-by-line manual review of the entire codebase by community auditors.

### <a id="M01"></a> M-01 `_getActualTakerFillableAmount` Will Return `_takerCollateralAmount - _offerInfo.takerFilledAmount` Even If The Order Is Not Fillable

#### Description:

Since this https://github.com/GuardianAudits/DivaAudit/blob/main/diva-contracts/contracts/libraries/LibEIP712.sol#L555 is an internal function with little knowledge where it would be used , it is safe to say the output of this function is crucial.
Assume this scenario ->

1.) The `_makerCollateralAmount` is 0 (donation offer)

2.) `_offerInfo.status` is not OfferStatus.FILLABLE

As according to the above two points , the status is not fillable so the function should be expected to return 0,
but it returns `_takerCollateralAmount - _offerInfo.takerFilledAmount` because , the function body starts executing and hits the first if condition , As prev mentioned the collateral amount specified is 0 as it is a donation request , so it enters the `if` body and satisfies the condition of the `if` and therefore returns `_takerCollateralAmount - _offerInfo.takerFilledAmount`

While it should have returned 0 (offer was not fillable).

#### Recommendation:

A possible solution can be

```
if (_makerCollateralAmount == 0 && _offerInfo.status != OfferStatus.FILLABLE) {
            // Use case: donation request by maker
            return 0;
        }
```

### <a id="L01"></a> L-01 Diamond facet upgrade

#### Description

If during an upgrade calls are executed in multiple Ethereum transactions, users may be exposed to contracts that are upgraded only partially, i.e., some of the
functions are upgraded while others are not. This may result in unexpected inconsistencies.

#### Recommendation

We recommend upgrading the contracts in a single transaction, or making the fallback function pausable for the duration of an upgrade.

### <a id="L02"></a> L-02 Centralization Risk in token supply can result in users being unable to remove DIVA owner

https://github.com/GuardianAudits/DivaAudit/blob/5d0c7f6d854b65c2f723ac6bceea6bbd4edef37e/diva-contracts/contracts/DIVAOwnershipMain.sol#L100-L114

#### Description:

The DIVA token has a fixed supply of 100m (verified by dev)

Shown here:

https://github.com/GuardianAudits/DivaAudit/blob/5d0c7f6d854b65c2f723ac6bceea6bbd4edef37e/diva-contracts/contracts/DIVAToken.sol#L1-L15

Also consider the following code:

```
// Confirm that `msg.sender` has strictly more support than the current owner
        if (_candidateToStakedAmount[msg.sender] <= _candidateToStakedAmount[_owner]) {
            revert InsufficientStakingSupport();
        }
```

https://github.com/GuardianAudits/DivaAudit/blob/5d0c7f6d854b65c2f723ac6bceea6bbd4edef37e/diva-contracts/contracts/DIVAOwnershipMain.sol#L111-L114

A user cannot start an election unless he/she has more staked token support than the current DIVAowner

This presents some problems, as it is very possible that a malicious whale DIVA owner can own enough of the circulating supply so that if the DIVA owner staked his tokens, no one would be able to challenge him in an election.

Considering the distribution model of the DIVA token, this is feasible as the owner does not need to own 51% of the total supply to pull this off

#### Recommendation:

Consider loosening the requirements of starting an election so that a whale can still lose their position even if they control most of the circulating supply

### <a id="L03"></a> L-03 User Will Lose Ether Which Was Sent to The Diamond Contract

#### Description:

Ether sent by a user here https://github.com/GuardianAudits/DivaAudit/blob/main/diva-contracts/contracts/Diamond.sol#L191 would be locked/lost forever i.e. their is no functionality to withdraw the sent amount neither by the user nor the owner.

#### Recommendation:

Since their is no use of native currency on the Diamond contract , consider removing the receive function altogether.

---

### <a id="L04"></a> L-04 Voting for a different owner can become impossible

https://github.com/GuardianAudits/DivaAudit/blob/main/diva-contracts/contracts/DIVAOwnershipMain.sol

#### Description:

As stated in the documentation, the stake function is used to 'vote' for a new protocol owner, and the documentation specifies that the minimum staking period is 7 days. This means that if a user stakes, for example, 50 DIVA tokens, they can only retrieve them after 7 days. If they change their mind and no longer wish to vote for the owner. To verify that the minimum staking period has passed, line 150 implements a check with the formula: `uint _minStakingPeriodEnd = _voterToTimestampLastStake[msg.sender] + _minStakingPeriod`. However, suppose the same user stakes another 50 tokens, for example, 3 days after staking the initial 50 tokens. In that case, the mapping will update to a minimum unstaking period of 10 days from the initial staking date, instead of the required 7 days according to the protocol docs. So the user will not be able to unstake his first staked amount after 7 days but after 10.

#### Recommendation:

Implement a logic that tracks the days for “each stake” of each user.

### <a id="I01"></a> I-01 Violation Of Checks Effects Interation Pattern

#### Description:

Eventhough every CEI pattern violation does not gurantee
that there is a reentrancy possible , it is always a good coding practice follow the pattern. Here are the code snippets where it was violated(transfer was done before some state updates) ->

https://github.com/GuardianAudits/DivaAudit/blob/main/diva-contracts/contracts/libraries/LibDIVA.sol#L654-L663

and

https://github.com/GuardianAudits/DivaAudit/blob/main/diva-contracts/contracts/DIVAOwnershipMain.sol#L80-L94

### <a id="I02"></a> I-02 revokeResolvedFeesUpdate Won't Work When There Is Only One Element In The Array

It is not mentioned in the comments nor in the docs that in
the function revokeResolvedFeesUpdate https://github.com/GuardianAudits/DivaAudit/blob/main/diva-contracts/contracts/facets/GovernanceFacet.sol#L243
the gs.fees array would have atleast one value after deployment which can't be challenged , because if it is assumed that this is not the case , then at L260 we perform a pop action which would make the array empty(assuming only one element)and then L263 would always revert due to underflow. In short first element's fee update won't be revoked.

### <a id="I03"></a> I-03 Functions , Variables And Parameters In Snake Case

#### Description:

Use camel case for all functions, parameters and variables and snake case for constants.

### <a name="G-3"></a>[G-3] Functions guaranteed to revert when called by normal users can be marked `payable`

If a function modifier such as `onlyOwner` is used, the function will revert if a normal user tries to pay the function. Marking the function as `payable` will lower the gas cost for legitimate callers because the compiler will not include checks for whether a payment was provided.

_Instances (5)_:

```solidity
File: GovernanceFacet.sol

179:     function updateTreasury(address _newTreasury) external override onlyOwner {

210:     function pauseReturnCollateral() external override onlyOwner {

377:     function revokeResolvedTreasuryUpdate() external override onlyOwner {

```

### <a name="G-4"></a>[G-4] `++i` costs less gas than `i++`, especially when it's used in `for`-loops (`--i`/`i--` too)

_Saves 5 gas per loop_

_Instances (1)_:

```solidity
File: DiamondLoupeFacet.sol

18:         for (uint256 i; i < numFacets; i++) {

```

### <a name="G-5"></a>[G-5] Use != 0 instead of > 0 for unsigned integer comparison

### <a name="GAS-6"></a>[G-6] Internal functions only called once can be inlined

```solidity
File: DIVAOwnershipMain.sol: 238-241

```

Description: Internal functions only called once can be inlined
Not inlining costs 20 to 40 gas because of two extra JUMP instructions and additional stack operations needed for function calls.
Recommendation: Include the function logic instead where the function is called instead of creating a new function for this.

### <a name="GAS-7"></a>[G-7] Using getter functions consume more gas

DIVAOwnershipMain.sol: 183-185
DIVAOwnershipMain.sol: 193-915
DIVAOwnershipMain.sol: 197-199
DIVAOwnershipMain.sol: 201-203
DIVAOwnershipMain.sol: 205-207
DIVAOwnershipMain.sol: 209-211
DIVAOwnershipMain.sol: 213-216
DIVAOwnershipMain.sol: 217-219
DIVAOwnershipMain.sol: 221-223
DIVAOwnershipMain.sol: 225-227
```

Description: Using getter functions consume more gas than calling to public variables.
Recommendation: Change private variables to public instead of having getter functions.

### <a name="G-8"></a>[G-8] <x> += <y> Costs More Gas

```solidity
DIVAOwnershipMain.sol:91
DIVAOwnershipMain.sol:94
DIVAOwnershipMain.sol:162
DIVAOwnershipMain.sol:163
DIVADevelopmentFund.sol: 89
DIVADevelopmentFund.sol: 223
DIVADevelopmentFund.sol: 98
```

Description: <x> += <y> Costs More Gas Than <x> = <x> + <y> For State Variables

### <a name="G-9"></a>[G-9] Use Custom Error Strings

```solidity
DIVADevelopmentFund.sol: 102
DIVADevelopmentFund.sol: 123
Description: Instead of using error strings, to reduce deployment and runtime cost, you should use Custom Errors. This would save both deployment and runtime cost.
```

### <a name="G-10"></a>[G-10] ps Variable Can Be Inlined

```solidity
LiquidityFacet.sol:110
```

Description: ps variable can be inlined on line 111.

### <a id="G-11"></a> [G-11] Use while loop instead of for loop

#### Description:

Instead of writing the following for loop with the following syntax

`For (uint256 i = 0; i < len; )`

Replace it with

`while (uint i < len)`

to save gas
